# OpenSUTD Visual Identity
## Open call for OpenSUTD logo - April '19
Calling for designers and contributors - like all things OpenSUTD, our visual identity is up for co-creation! This includes our logo, our palette, and visual design principles. After all, the community should be the one to design its identity, right?

Get started by looking at [**Issue #5: Logo Change**](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/community/issues/5).

### Start with a vector `.ai` file
Optimize for screens (RGB). OpenSUTD is currently very much an internet community, and we don't expect to be printing (yet!).
### Raster copies in `.png` and `.jpg`
Export small file sizes for web display, etc. Common sizes are square 200px, 500px and 1000px.
### Different variants
 A lockup is simply a different layout configuration.

For example, if your logo is made up of both typography and an icon, you might have 2 layout variants such as; a long/thin version with the icon to the left of the text, and another with the icon above the text. Hereâ€™s an example from [logogeek.uk](https://logogeek.uk):
