# OpenSUTD Community Standards

OpenSUTD modelled after the idea of an **Open Organisation**, and we have community standards for all members to abide by in order to ensure a good enviroment for members to learn and contribute effectively.

> An Open Organization is one that **engages participative communities both inside and out**; responds to opportunities more quickly, has access to resources and talent outside the organization, and **inspires, motivates, and empowers people at all levels to act**. **- [Open Organisation Definition](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/open-org-definition)**

This is the community repository. All material relevant to the advancement and maintenance of OpenSUTD are kept here and open for review and feedback, and shapes our direction as a Open Community.

## Important information

We're always looking for collaborators to act as community architects and evangelists to help us manage the community and drive new initiatives. If you are interested, reach out to us by emailing `timothy_liu[at]mymail.sutd.edu.sg` and `qingze_hum[at]mymail.sutd.edu.sg`!
