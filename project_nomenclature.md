# Project Nomenclature

The objective is to ensure easier navigation through a naming convention that makes sense for typical use cases.

## Key Repositories
### Community

Propose having a common theme that reflects the goals of OpenSUTD throughout all naming conventions. This could resonate with a common mascot such as [Wapuu](https://www.elmastudio.de/en/wapuu-the-official-wordpress-mascot/) to give OpenSUTD a friendly community vibe.

### Course Material

It's like eDimension but better!

* Courses with their code and canonical name, e.g. `10.001 Advanced Math I`
* Lecture slides should have the week number and a descriptive filename, e.g. `Week 10 - James Scott - Commentary on Jacob's work.pdf`
* Subdirectories as needed, e.g. `/Additional Readings` or `/src`

### Fifth Rows

Recommend crowdsourcing ideas on this.
