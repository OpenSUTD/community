# Contributing to OpenSUTD
There are essentially two main ways to contribute to OpenSUTD.

1. **Contribute material**  by creating a new repository or forking from another (that belongs to you)! This prototype is still in its infancy, so we're looking for collaborators to act as community architects or tech evangelists. In the case of legacy course materials, curators should have taken the course before.

2. **Join projects!** We hope that this will improve project maintenance across generations of SUTD students. Let's set up a standard set of project management best practices to facilitate this. eg. Badges

3. **Build the community** and be a part of the community architect or technolgy evangelist team.

## Key Repositories
General locations where commonly accessed material is stored

### Community
All material relevant to the advancement and maintenance of OpenSUTD are kept here.

### Course Material
This should be a space to encourage self-improvement and share knowledge, not spoon-feed it. What's fair game for contribution:
* Past lecture materials
* Past quiz, assignment, and homework questions
* Posters
* Project reports
* Personal notes and projects

What **shouldn't** be here:
* Quiz, examination, and homework **answers** (Tips and notes are fine)

### Fifth Rows
We hope that Fifth Rows will set up pages to improve accessibility to relevant information.
