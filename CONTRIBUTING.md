# Contributing to OpenSUTD
There are essentially three main ways to contribute to OpenSUTD.

1. **Contribute new material**  by creating a new repository or forking from another (that belongs to you)! We're always looking for collaborators to act as community architects or tech evangelists. In the case of legacy course materials, curators should have taken the course before, and have written permission from the course instructor to share materials within academic guidelines (e.g. no sharing of answers or test questions). Just keep the [naming scheme of the projects consistent](PROJECT_NOMENCLATURE.md) for the sake of organisation.

2. **Join existing projects**: view a more detailed set of guides [here](CONTRIBUTION_DETAILED_GUIDE.md).

3. **Build the community** and be a part of the community architect or technolgy evangelist team to be part of the core team to contribute and review new ideas or policies to improve OpenSUTD. (Of course, you can still contribute ideas if you're not on the team, but being part of the team means you're more involved in our discussions and review process!)

## Key Repositories

### Fifth Rows

We hope that Fifth Rows will set up pages to improve accessibility to relevant information. This includes putting up their materials, knowledge management practices, or even an official fifth-row webpage (something like a micro-site)

### Course Material

This should be a space to encourage self-improvement and share knowledge, not spoon-feed it. What's fair game for contribution:
* Past lecture materials
* Past quiz, assignment, and homework questions
* Posters
* Project reports
* Personal notes and projects

What **shouldn't** be here:
* Quiz, examination, and homework **answers** (Tips and *student-created* notes are fine)
* Official course notes should not be uploaded without express permission from the instructor

### Community Repository

This is the community repository. All material relevant to the advancement and maintenance of OpenSUTD are kept here and open for review and feedback, and shapes our direction as a Open Community.
