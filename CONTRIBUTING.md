# Contributing to OpenSUTD

There are essentially three main ways to contribute to OpenSUTD.

1. **Contribute new projects and material**

2. **Join existing projects**: 

3. **Build the community** and be a part of the OpenSUTD team to contribute and review new ideas or policies to improve OpenSUTD. (Of course, you can still contribute ideas if you're not on the team, but being part of the team means you're more involved in our discussions and review process, which we will also try to keep as open as possible.)



## Contributing New Projects

This can be new projects, materials or even web pages for events or fifth rows.

1. Ask for access to the GitHub organisation by emailing `timothy_liu[at]mymail.sutd.edu.sg`
2. Create a new repository inside the Github organisation. You may also fork in a repository from elsewhere (e.g. your own GitHub profile, or another repository). Just keep the [naming scheme of the projects consistent](PROJECT_NOMENCLATURE.md) for the sake of overall organisation. 

Sometimes, you might have a different idea for a project that already exists on OpenSUTD (for example, [another timetable app](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/sutd-timetable)). And that's great! We only ask that you consider if it is possible to contribute features (e.g. a different mode) to the current project to avoid unnecessary duplication of work. If that is not ideal, we still welcome your project!

### Fifth Rows

We hope that Fifth Rows will set up pages to improve accessibility to relevant information. This includes putting up their materials, knowledge management practices, or even an official fifth-row webpage (or something like a micro-site). Using GitHub, you can host static web pages for free!

1. Learn more about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
2. Create a GitHub repository. We recommend creating it inside the OpenSUTD GitHub organisation. Reach out to `timothy_liu[at]mymail.sutd.edu.sg` if you are not yet a member of the GitHub organisation.
3. To request for a special subdomain (e.g. `ieee.opensutd.org`), please open an issue at [OpenSUTD/subdomains](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/subdomains).

Existing fifth row pages:

* [IEEE](https://ieee.opensutd.org/)

## Contributing Course Materials

OpenSUTD aims to create spaces to encourage self-improvement and share knowledge.

We welcome:

* Student-curated study materials (e.g. course summaries)
* Posters, links to YouTube videos or other media
* 3D files (e.g. `stl`)
* Any personal notes and projects

What **shouldn't** be here:
* Quiz, examination, and **homework answers** (Tips and *student-created* notes are fine)
* Official course notes should not be uploaded without express permission from the instructor

## One-time Contributions

Sometimes, you just want to make a small, one-time contribution to one of the projects on OpenSUTD. You can do so by following this [short guide](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTION_DETAILED_GUIDE.md).
